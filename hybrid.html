                        <p>24K Gold, also known as 24K or Kosher Tangie, is a cross of Tangie and Kosher Kush, bred by
                            DNA Genetics in Amsterdam. The seed bank has identified three 24K Gold phenotypes; one of
                            which has a prominent kush flavor with citrus undertones, and another with a Tangie-leaning
                            flavor.

                            According to DNA Genetics, the strain has an Indica-leaning lineage, but grows tall and
                            produces above-average yields (450 to 550 grams per square meter, or 0.99 to 1.12 pounds per
                            square foot) of resinous buds in a 63-70 day flowering period. The breeder also claims that
                            24K Gold produces a strong tangerine scent and kush-flavored buds. 24K Gold won third Place
                            at the Milano Secret Cup in 2018.

                        <p>ACDC is a phenotype of the high-CBD strain Cannatonic (also known as the CBD Queen)
                            that was
                            selected by Dr. William Courtney after receiving a packet of seeds from its original
                            breeder, Spain-based Resin Seeds.

                            The resulting ACDC, which is only available on the market as a clone, is
                            exceptionally high
                            in CBD, with a 20:1 CBD-to-THC ratio, according to testing from SC Labs. Resin Seeds
                            describes the plant’s aroma as a mix of cherry, diesel, gas, and Mandarin peel.
                            Myrcene is a
                            dominant terpene in ACDC.

                            ACDC is a parent to several CBD-rich hybrids. Sin City Seeds offers four ACDC
                            hybrids with
                            varying CBD-to-THC ratios — Thunderstruck (an S1 hybrid of ACDC and ACDC), Treasure
                            Island
                            (Swiss Gold and ACDC), HarleSin (ACDC and Harlequin), and Incredible Power (OmRita,
                            BluePower, and ACDC).

                            Other notable hybrids include TOCI (ACDC and Xena), EMT (ACDC and Canna-Tsu) from
                            Med Tree
                            Seeds, Valhalla (ACDC and Sky Dragon) from Love Genetics, and CBD Rich Blessing from
                            Bodhi
                            Seeds. A hybrid of ACDC and a CBD-rich Good Medicine male, CBD Rich Blessing has, in
                            turn,
                            been used by its breeder to cultivate several other CBD-rich hybrids.

                            The strain reportedly grows to average height, producing thin leaves and medium
                            yields of
                            big, dewy buds. The strain grows best indoors and in warm environments. It’s
                            reported to
                            flower in 63-70 days, possibly longer in colder areas. ACDC can be finicky, so
                            novice and
                            intermediate growers with limited grow space may want to look elsewhere for a
                            high-CBD
                            plant.

                            The ACDC clone typically produces short, bushy plants with thin leaves that tend to
                            grow
                            about four feet tall. An ACDC clone Harborside submitted for genetic testing by
                            Phylos
                            Bioscience showed moderate levels of genetic variation.</p>

                        <p>While its exact genetics remain a mystery, Acapulco Gold is a popular and
                            historically
                            significant sativa-leaning hybrid that thrives in outdoor grow environments and is
                            indigenous to Acapulco, Mexico. As indoor cultivation becomes the go-to method for
                            many
                            growers, the original Acapulco Gold cultivar is considered to be a bit of a rarity
                            within
                            modern-day cannabis cultivation circles.

                            Known to produce an energetic and cerebral high, a true Acapulco Gold plant is
                            distinguishable by its sativa growth traits, yielding chunky colas that range from
                            dark
                            green to golden brown in color. Carrying an aroma that has been described as burnt
                            toffee,
                            Acapulco Gold is reported to produce an earthy, pungent taste upon consumption.

                            Although the strain is best suited for outdoor growing conditions, cultivators
                            should have
                            less difficulty with the newer generation of Acapulco Gold seeds. Following a
                            60-to-70-day
                            flowering period, one Acapulco Gold strain is reported to yield up to 500 grams per
                            square
                            meter indoors and, if properly harvested outdoors in the Northern Hemisphere by
                            mid-October,
                            up to 1 1/2 kilograms per plant.

                        <p>Black Widow is an Indica-leaning hybrid of Brazilian and south Indian landraces that
                            was
                            originally cultivated by breeder Scott Blakey -- aka Shantibaba -- under the name
                            White
                            Widow.

                            When Blakey and breeder Howard Marks -- aka Mr. Nice -- left Green House Seed
                            Company in the
                            late 1990s, they changed the name to Black Widow to distinguish their plant from
                            White Widow
                            strains sold by other seed banks.

                            Today -- as noted by its Dutch seed bank, Mr. Nice Seeds -- Black Widow is an
                            easy-to-grow
                            plant that offers decent yields of frosty, resinous buds in a 56-70 day flowering
                            period. It
                            was a 1st Place winner at the 1995 High Times Cannabis Cup.

                            The seed bank recommends indoor, hydroponic, or greenhouse growing. Growers should
                            expect
                            vigorous development of resin frost and a strong aroma during the final weeks of
                            flowering.

                            Both regular and feminized Black Widow seeds are available from Mr. Nice.

                        <p>OG Kush is a world-famous strain first propagated by Matt Berger in Florida. The
                            strain was
                            later popularized after JoshD was able to perfect the growing conditions and
                            introduce the
                            variety into the Los Angeles market. JoshD Farms reports OG Kush users can expect
                            long-lasting, heavy, yet versatile euphoria and skunky-citrus flavor and aroma. The
                            company
                            is now focused exclusively on developing OG Kush-derived strains and products.

                            JoshD Farms reports an average THC content of 20% from OG Kush, with some indoor
                            grows
                            testing as high as 26%. Myrcene, Limonene, and caryophyllene are the dominant
                            terpenes of
                            the strain. According to JoshD Farms, phenotypes and offspring that honor OG Kush’s
                            signature effect and flavor profile include Kosher Kush, Triangle Kush, Skywalker
                            OG, and
                            Loompa’s Headband.

                            Matt Berger said he obtained the originating strain, a ’90s favorite of Snoop Dogg
                            and
                            B-Real of Cypress Hill, in Florida where it was shared exclusively among local
                            growers under
                            the name Kryptonite, or Krippy, to designate its alleged Seattle origins. It was
                            shipped
                            from Seattle to Florida in dense bricks and also referred to as Supernaut and Kush.

                            Del Rosso said the strain was passed between Florida breeders Alec Anderson and Matt
                            “Bubba”
                            Berger in 1992. Berger, who was the first to cultivate Kush seeds in Florida from a
                            random
                            bag of flower, later shared the strain with Del Rosso in Los Angeles. Berger was
                            also
                            reportedly the first to coin the name Kush after a friend called the strain’s
                            especially
                            frosty colas “Kushberries,” with no intentional reference to the Hindu Kush
                            mountains where
                            other “Kush” strains originate.

                            OG Kush also came in 1st place for the Weedmaps March Madness competition in 2020.
